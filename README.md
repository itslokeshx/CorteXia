# CorteXia - Your Life, Understood. Powered by AI.

A unified, AI-powered personal life operating system designed with surgical precision, calm authority, and invisible elegance. CorteXia integrates every dimension of personal life management into one intelligent system.

TESTING BRANCHING!

## Vision

CorteXia is the world's first unified personal life operating system that competes with and surpasses fragmented productivity tools like Notion and Obsidian. It treats your life as a cohesive system, not isolated domains.

### Core Concept

CorteXia integrates ALL aspects of personal life management into ONE intelligent system:

- **Tasks & To-Dos** - Hierarchical task management with priority and time tracking
- **Time Tracking** - Deep analytics on how you spend your hours with focus quality metrics
- **Habit Tracking** - Streak-based habit management with GitHub-style calendar visualization
- **Finance Tracking** - Budget management, spending analytics, and financial insights
- **Study Sessions** - Learning goal tracking with subject breakdown and focus level monitoring
- **Screen Time** - Real-time screen usage analytics with health implications
- **Journal Entries** - Reflective journaling with AI-powered summaries and pattern detection
- **Goal Architecture** - Hierarchical goal system with milestones and progress tracking
- **AI-Powered Insights** - Cross-domain pattern detection, behavioral analysis, and recommendations

## Design Philosophy

- **Surgical Precision** - Every pixel justified, no wasted space
- **Calm Authority** - Like Claude.ai, sophisticated but approachable
- **Invisible Until Needed** - No clutter, information reveals on interaction
- **Truth Over Decoration** - Color only when meaningful; data-driven design
- **Addictive Through Clarity** - Engaging through understanding, not gamification
