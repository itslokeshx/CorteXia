# CorteXia - Your Life, Understood. Powered by AI.

A unified, AI-powered personal life operating system designed with surgical precision, calm authority, and invisible elegance. CorteXia integrates every dimension of personal life management into one intelligent system.

> **This is NOT mock data. This is NOT a read-only UI. This is a COMPLETE, FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION.**

## 🌟 What's New

### Cortexia AI Assistant (v2.0)

A powerful, always-available AI chatbot that works across ALL pages:

- **General Intelligence** - Ask ANY question (trivia, advice, coding help, etc.) and get smart answers
- **Voice Commands** - Use natural language to manage your life: _"Add buy groceries to my tasks"_
- **Full CRUD Operations** - Create, update, delete tasks, habits, goals, expenses, and more via chat
- **Smart Suggestions** - AI suggests relevant actions after answering your questions
- **Cross-Page Access** - Floating chat button available on every page
- **Offline Fallback** - Smart local parsing when API is unavailable

**Example commands:**

- _"Who directed Inception?"_ → Answers + suggests adding to watchlist
- _"Create a goal called Learn Python and add 3 tasks to it"_
- _"I spent $50 on groceries"_ → Logs expense automatically
- _"Show my priorities for today"_ → Full daily overview
- _"I studied machine learning for 2 hours"_ → Logs study session

## Vision

CorteXia is the world's first unified personal life operating system that competes with and surpasses fragmented productivity tools like Notion and Obsidian. It treats your life as a cohesive system, not isolated domains.

### Core Concept

CorteXia integrates ALL aspects of personal life management into ONE intelligent system:

- **Tasks & To-Dos** - Full CRUD with priority, categories, time estimates, and completion tracking
- **Time Tracking** - Deep analytics on how you spend your hours with focus quality metrics
- **Habit Tracking** - Streak-based habit management with GitHub-style calendar visualization
- **Finance Tracking** - Budget management, spending analytics, and financial insights
- **Study Sessions** - Learning goal tracking with subject breakdown and focus level monitoring
- **Journal Entries** - Reflective journaling with AI-powered summaries and pattern detection
- **Goal Architecture** - Hierarchical goal system with milestones and progress tracking
- **AI-Powered Insights** - Cross-domain pattern detection via Groq/Llama AI integration
- **Conversational AI** - Natural language assistant for hands-free life management

## Design Philosophy

- **Surgical Precision** - Every pixel justified, no wasted space
- **Calm Authority** - Like Claude.ai, sophisticated but approachable
- **Invisible Until Needed** - No clutter, information reveals on interaction
- **Truth Over Decoration** - Color only when meaningful; data-driven design
- **Addictive Through Clarity** - Engaging through understanding, not gamification
